## Problem Statement

Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner.  
You may only move down or right.

In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with dimensions m * n?

Write a function `grid_traveler(m, n)` that calculates this.

**For example:**  
- grid_traveler(1, 1) = 1  
- grid_traveler(2, 3) = 3  
- grid_traveler(3, 2) = 3  
- grid_traveler(3, 3) = 6
