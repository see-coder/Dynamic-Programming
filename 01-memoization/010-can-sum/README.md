## Problem Statement

Write a function `can_sum(target_sum, numbers)` that takes in a target_sum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to generate the target_sum using numbers from the array.

You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.

You may assume that all input numbers are non-negative.

**For example:**  
- can_sum(7, [2, 3]) = True  
- can_sum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]) = True  
- can_sum(7, [2, 4]) = False  
- can_sum(8, [2, 3, 5]) = True
