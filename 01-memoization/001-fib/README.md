## Problem Statement

Write a function `fib(n)` that takes in a number as an argument.  
The function should return the n-th number of the fibonacci sequence.

The 1st and 2nd number of the sequence is 1.  
To generate the next number of the sequence, we sum the previous two.

`fibonacci sequence:` 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
